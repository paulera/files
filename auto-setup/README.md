This folder has helpers for setting configurations of software.
The one for vim stuff is very used and is working well. The others
might die. Perhaps some of them could go to the resources folder
in the form of example configuration files. For example, the one
manipulating wsl.conf coul easily break it, so perhaps it is better
to stay as an example for referene instead of an automation.
