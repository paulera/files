Files here are not used by FILES. They are just resources as
configuration and etc. Dotfiles are not included here
but they could. Or maybe I could refactor a better approach
for storing configurations in general (terminal options,
example files, dotfiles, etc).

Some things that could be refactored and move in here:
* dircolors
* inputrc
* jay.vim
* vimrc
